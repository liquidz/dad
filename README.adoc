Dad is a small configuration management tool for Clojure.
This project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/itamae-kitchen/mitamae[mitamae].

== Concept

=== 🤯 Minimum to remember
* May not write code for Dad often.
//* Minimum to remember -- May not write code for Dad often
* Write codes as a https://github.com/babashka/pods[babashka pod].
** You can gain benefits from code completion and docstring references.
//* Easy to start -- Download single binary and run it.

=== 🍟 Easy to start
* Download single binary and run it.
* Run the code written as a babashka pod as it is.
** Dad ignores codes related to loading pods.


== Getting Started

Download binary from https://github.com/liquidz/dad/releases[releases].
[source,terminal]
----
# Download latest dad to the current working directory
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liquidz/dad/master/script/download | bash
./dad your_task.clj
----

Here is a example to install Clojure https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli[command line tools].
[source,clojure]
----
#!/usr/bin/env dad --no-color --dry-run
(ns example.core
  (:require
   [babashka.pods :as pods]))

;; Load dad as a babashka pod
(pods/load-pod "dad")
(require '[pod.liquidz.dad :as dad])

(dad/package {:name ["curl" "rlwrap"]})

;; You can define function as you like
(defn curl [m]
  (let [{:keys [path url]} m]
    ;; `file-exists?` is a built-in function in dad.
    (when (and (not (dad/file-exists? path))
               (string? url))
      (dad/execute {:command (str "curl -sfLo " path " " url)}))))

(curl {:path "/tmp/install.sh"
       :url "https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.1.489.sh"})

(dad/file {:path "/tmp/install.sh" :mode "755"})
(dad/execute {:cwd "/tmp" :command "./install.sh"})
(dad/file {:path "/tmp/install.sh" :action :delete})
----

== Supports

- [x] Ubuntu (`apt`)
- [x] macOS (link:https://brew.sh[Homebrew])

== Example

- link:./example/vim[Building vim by source]
- link:./test/resources/test_task/tasks.clj[Test task]
